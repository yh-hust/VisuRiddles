# üëã Introduction
Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS),  an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks.

- **[`22/10/2025`]**: Updated the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02537) paper with the PAVR training paradigm and RL experiment results.
- **[`04/06/2025`]**: Release the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yh0075/VisuRiddles) and evaluation script.
- **[`04/06/2025`]**: Our paper is now accessible at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02537).

# üìå Highlights


- **We introduce VisuRiddles, a multi-dimensional benchmark for abstract visual reasoning (AVR).** It systematically covers five key perceptual dimensions‚Äînumerosity, attribute, style, position, and spatial relation‚Äîas well as high-level analogical and consistency-based reasoning.

- **State-of-the-art MLLMs perform near random on AVR tasks.** Experiments reveal that the main bottleneck lies in fine-grained perceptual understanding of complex structures, rather than reasoning alone.

- **Fine-grained perceptual descriptions significantly boost model performance.** Recasting abstract graphics into perceptual terms enables MLLMs to solve AVR tasks much more accurately, underscoring the importance of perceptual ability.

- **We develop an automated synthesis framework for fully-annotated AVR samples.** This enables end-to-end supervision from perception to reasoning, facilitating more systematic model learning and generalization.

# ‚úÖ To-do
- [ ] Release synthesis code (e.g., positional and stylistic rule)
- [ ] Release the validation dataset with perceptual description

# üî® Evaluation
You can use either of the following files for inference, depending on your needs:

- **run_offline.py**: For open-source model inference (offline, local).
- **run_online.py**: For closed-source model inference using the Yunwu API (online/cloud).  
  > Yunwu API: [https://yunwu.ai.com/](https://yunwu.ai.com/)

You can choose one of the following ways to run the inference:

## Option 1: Run a Single Model via Bash Script
You can directly run a single model inference using a bash script. For example, to run inference with GPT-4o:
```bash
python evaluate/metric_cal.py --result_file /path/to/your/result.json
```

Both scripts will generate a result file containing model predictions.After inference, use the evaluation script to calculate metrics:

```bash
bash scripts/online/inference_gpt4o.sh
```
Feel free to modify the script or create new ones for different models as needed.

## Option 2: Run Multiple Models in Parallel via Python
You can also run multiple model inference scripts in parallel using `run_online.py`. To do this, modify the `scripts`parameter in the Python script. For example:
```bash
scripts = [
    './scripts/online/inference_gpt4o.sh',
    './scripts/online/inference_claude.sh'
]
```
Then, run the script with:
```bash
python run_online.py
```

Replace /path/to/your/result.json with the path to your actual result file.The script outputs accuracy for each task category and overall performance.
